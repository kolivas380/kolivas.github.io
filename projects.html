        <h1>Price Validator</h1>
        <p>
          During my summer internship with Best Buy, I had a chance to
          create a tool that would be helpful in confirming and ensuring
          the accuracy of prices across the different applications that
          stored the prices that you see on the Best Buy website and
          stores. This was an internal facing tool that proved to be beneficial
          for developers and QA testers. The tool took in two inputs that would
          then call our backend and present the prices on a table. If there is
          price discrepency, the column will highligh red, making it clear
          there is a price inaccuracy and allowing the appropriate team to 
          investigate.

        <h1>Code-Sync Mobile App</h1>
        <p>
          During my internship with Girls Dream Code, I helped create
          their first mobile-app called Code-Sync. This app is was built
          by members of Girls Dream Code for those inside the
          organization. It is a tool used to build a stronger community
          within the organization while providing valuable experience.
          Here, I learned more about the use of APIs and creating a 
          good user experience. Code-Sync contains a real time
          prompts feature, OTP authentication, the ability to customize
          your user profile, resources to expose the 
          opportunities there are in tech, and more! 
          This app was built from scratch and has
          been officially deployed to the Apple App Store and the Google
          Play Store!

        <h1>Detecting Fake News through Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
          Fake news is a rampant issue going on in today's digital world.
          This makes it more difficult to get the correct facts, especially when it comes to making
          informed decisions during presidential elections. Through machine learning, we trained models
          to detect when an article may contain aspects of inaccurate details. The main approach was to
          detect certain patterns through sentiment analysis. 
          This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and performance analysis to enhance model accuracy.
          I implemented logistic regression for model training and evaluation, achieving a balanced test-train data split for optimal results.
