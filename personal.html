                    Hello! I am Kayla Olivas, an upcoming software engineer at Best Buy. 
                    I grew up in sunny Arizona and moved to Minnesota to study at St. Catherine University. 
                    I grew up in a Mexican household and I am a first generation college graduate. 
                    I am passionate about getting more women, especially those in underrepresented communities into the tech industry.
