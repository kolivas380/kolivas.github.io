                  <h2>Family</h2>
                  <p>
                    I was raised my my Mexican parents and have two sisters. 
                    Growing up, my parents used to always take us to visit our 
                    family in Mexico since we were so close to the border in Arizona.
                    It kept me closer to our culture and allows me to embrace it in 
                    every room I'm in. I am a first generation graduate who aspires
                    to get more Latina women in tech.

                  <p>
                    This is my family's bulldog, Chapo! For being a bulldog,
                    he is very energetic and loves people as much as he
                    loves food. His favorite pass times are sleeping and 
                    riding his beloved skateboard.

                  <h2>Travel</h2>
                  <p>
                    I had the opportunity to study abroad the summer of my
                    junior year in college and it was one of the most 
                    incredible experiences I've had. Learning more about different
                    cultures and seeing different parts of the world has sparked my desire to 
                    travel as much as I can in my lifetime. This photo was taken during
                    my walk to class in Granada, Spain!

                  <h2>Food</h2>
                  <p>
                    Living in a Mexican household, I grew up eating many
                    of the traditional dishes. Food is not only fuel, but apart
                    of our culture. When I moved half way across the country
                    from my family, cooking made me feel closer to them and was a way I 
                    express appreciation to my friends. I also enjoy trying different
                    cuisines, one of my favorite being Asian cuisine!

                  <h2>Movement</h2>
                  <p>
                    One of my most important hobbies is exercise. Not only do I
                    feel better after doing it, but it is also something that I
                    enjoy learning more about. The summer of 2025, I trained and 
                    participated in my first triathalon! I enjoy to run, bike, and lift weights. 
                    I also trained to run the TCM 10 mile and have a goal to
                    run a marathon one day!

                  <h2>Reading</h2>
                  <p>
                    Reading helps me unwind from long days and is something
                    I enjoy doing. I like fiction novels for the exciting 
                    story plots, but I also enjoy reading informational books.
                    I bought the book above in London, and it talked about the benefits
                    of walking.
